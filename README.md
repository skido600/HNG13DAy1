# **FactFetch API: A Node.js Express Backend** ‚ú®

A robust Node.js Express API demonstrating foundational backend development practices, including modular routing, centralized error handling, and seamless external API integration. This service efficiently fetches interesting cat facts and provides a static user profile, showcasing a clean, maintainable project structure.

# FactFetch API

## Overview
This is a Node.js Express API server designed to fetch random cat facts from an external API and serve a predefined user profile. It utilizes Express.js for routing and middleware, with `dotenv` for environment variable management, and implements custom error handling.

## Features
- `Express.js`: Handles API routing and global middleware management.
- `dotenv`: Manages environment variables for secure configuration.
- `Node's native 'fetch' API`: Integrates seamlessly with external APIs (catfact.ninja).
- `Custom Error Handling Middleware`: Provides centralized management for server errors (500) and unhandled routes (404).

## Getting Started
### Installation
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd day1
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (`day1/`) and add the following required variable:

-   `PORT`: The port on which the Express server will listen.
    ```
    PORT=3000
    ```

## API Documentation
### Base URL
`http://localhost:{PORT}`

### Endpoints
#### `GET /me`
Retrieves a predefined user profile along with a randomly fetched cat fact.

**Request**:
No request body or query parameters are required for this endpoint.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "user": {
    "email": "ebisileonard@gmail.com",
    "name": "Ebisi chinecherem leonard",
    "stack": "node js express newbie in goland"
  },
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z",
  "fact": "A cat's brain is biologically very similar to a human brain."
}
```

**Errors**:
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected server-side error occurred, potentially during the fetching of the external cat fact.
    ```json
    {
      "success": false,
      "status": 500,
      "message": "error fetching fact"
    }
    ```
-   `404 Not Found`: The requested route does not exist.
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Route /nonexistent-route not found"
    }
    ```

## Usage
After completing the installation and setting up environment variables, you can start the development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server, typically on `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever `PORT` you configured).

To access the API, you can use a tool like `curl` or simply visit the endpoint in your web browser:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/me
```

The server will respond with the user's information and a fresh cat fact.

## Key Features
‚ú® Cat Fact Integration: Fetches fascinating facts from a public API to enrich responses.
üë§ User Profile Retrieval: Delivers a static user profile demonstrating basic data serving.
üõ°Ô∏è Robust Error Handling: Implements custom middleware to gracefully manage 404 Not Found errors and internal server issues.
üß± Modular Project Structure: Organizes code into controllers, routes, middleware, and utility functions for enhanced maintainability and scalability.
